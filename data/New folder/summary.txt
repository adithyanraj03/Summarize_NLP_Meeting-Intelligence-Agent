Google Meet has a premium feature which may not be available for your account. If your institution has access to the feature, tech administrators can enable it in the G Suite Admin Console. To record, start a Google Meet, click on the three dots button at the bottom right corner and choose record meeting. Once it is recorded it will be saved to Google Drive. To share the video, use Google Classroom, copy the link from Google Drive or download the video to your computer.
