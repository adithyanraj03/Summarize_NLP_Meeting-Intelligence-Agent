Google's enterprise version of G Suite allows users to record their video conferences for free, though it may not be available for all G Suite accounts. Technology administrators can enable recording in the G Suite Admin Console. Users can start recording by clicking the three dots in the bottom right corner of a Google Meet, let other attendant know that the meeting is being recorded, click accept, and end recording when finished. The recordings are stored in Google Drive and can be shared with others via email, social media, Google Classroom, or other methods.
