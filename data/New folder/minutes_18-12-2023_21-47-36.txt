* Let's think about our next 15 minutes.
* 
* Meeting Minutes 
* - Try to do half an hour meeting today and another half an hour on Friday
* - Narrating PowerPoints so when downloaded, it will be like me walking you through 
* - Everyone is just on their devices anyway
* - Taking 10-15 minutes to go over the learning objectives and process 
* - Going over the Zoom feature and chat feature 
* - Taking two-three minutes to jot down thoughts when hear word "nationalism" 
* - Thinking of national anthems, national flags, culture pride, and songs for association with nationalism
