Google made the premium feature available for free due to the COVID-19 situation, and it can be enabled by a G Suite admin in the Google Meet Settings under Recording. To record, start a Google Meet, click the three dots button in the bottom right corner and choose Record Meeting. Once finished, click the three docs button again and choose Stop Recording. Recordings will be saved to your Google Drive and you can share them with anyone by creating a shareable link.
