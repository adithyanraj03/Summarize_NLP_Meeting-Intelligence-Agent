Recording your conference is available with the enterprise version of G-Suite and may have to be enabled by your tech administrators. To record, start a Google Meet, let others know that it is being recorded, click the three dots button in the bottom right corner and then select 'Record Meeting'. When finished, click 'Stop Recording'. The recording can then be found in the 'Meet Recording' folder in Google Drive and can be shared with a link or QR code.
