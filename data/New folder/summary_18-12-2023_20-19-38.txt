The ability to do so is part of the enterprise version of G Suite or is temporarily available free due to the COVID-19 situation. Tech administrators need to turn it on in the G Suite Admin console under Google Meet Settings. To use, start a Google Meet, let others know the meeting is being recorded, then click record meeting. To stop recording, click stop recording. The recording will save to your Google Drive recordings folder, and you will receive an email with the link to the recording. You can easily share the link to anyone with the link (including publicly) and download a copy of the video.
