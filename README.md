# Summarize_NLP: Meeting Intelligence Agent

A powerful AI-driven application that captures, transcribes, summarizes, and distributes meeting content to participants automatically.

![AI Meeting Summarizer](https://github.com/adithyanraj03/Summarize/assets/39313793/065c3eff-e80f-4eea-979a-429dd2cf943d)

## üöÄ Overview

This intelligent application can be integrated with any online browser or application-based meeting to:
- Capture meeting audio
- Convert speech to text using advanced APIs
- Process and analyze the text with OpenAI
- Generate concise meeting summaries and detailed minutes 
- Automatically email the processed content to all participants

The system intelligently fetches participant emails from synced Excel files, Google Spreadsheets, or Google Forms, streamlining the entire workflow.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![Project Data Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adithyanraj03/Summarize_NLP_Meeting-Intelligence-Agent/main/meeting-minutes-dataflow-enhanced.svg)

The application follows a three-stage pipeline:
1. **Audio Capture & Conversion**: API converts speech to text
2. **Text Processing**: Python with OpenAI transforms text into structured minutes and summaries
3. **Automated Distribution**: Email system delivers processed content to all participants

## üíª Installation

### Automatic Installation

The easiest way to install is using the setup script:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important Note**: When using OpenAI functionality, you may see migration messages regarding API versions. You can:
- Run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase
- Pin your installation to the old version: `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

### Resending to Additional Recipients

To send meeting summaries to recipients who weren't included initially:

1. Locate and run the "AI_Re-sent_Mails.exe" utility in the root folder
2. Follow the prompts to select a previous meeting and specify new recipients
3. The system will resend the already-generated content to these new addresses

## üîß Technical Notes

The application uses several advanced technologies:
- PyTorch for audio processing
- Language detection for multi-language support
- OpenAI API for intelligent summarization
- SMTP/Email libraries for distribution
- Tkinter for the graphical interface

On first run, the system will download necessary model files, which may take a few moments depending on your connection speed.
