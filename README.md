## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
![Project Data Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c17f156-e8ff-41ba-9b51-28cb165763fd)

The application follows a three-stage pipeline:
1. **Audio Capture & Conversion**: API converts speech to text
2. **Text Processing**: Python with OpenAI transforms text into structured minutes and summaries
3. **Automated Distribution**: Email system delivers processed content to all participants

## üíª Installation

### Automatic Installation

The easiest way to install is using the setup script:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important Note**: When using OpenAI functionality, you may see migration messages regarding API versions. You can:
- Run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase
- Pin your installation to the old version: `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742
